The best billing system for your company is one that has all the financial features it needs. The key is to automate the entire procedure.
This is because having a billing system gives companies a competitive advantage. Although small enterprises and entrepreneurs commonly deal with money informally, systematizing how you charge elevates the level of professionalism.
Companies with systematic charging can receive and organize finances more easily, whether by bank drafts, cards, checks, and other payment methods.
Having a platform to manage receipts will make everyday work much more practical – and that's what we're going to talk about in the next topics.
What is a billing system?
A billing system is a platform designed for organizing and managing a company's collection and payment processes.
It’s a solution aimed at improving cash flow and streamlining collection processes, while also making them safer and more efficient.
The tool elevates the billing management process by automating, modernizing, and systematizing it.
Furthermore, management can take a 360-degree view of the company, determining what’s profitable, what needs support, and how to better organize company finances.
When a company has a small number of consumers, manually collecting payments may be possible; however, as a business grows and attracts more clients, operations become more complex.
That’s why adopting a billing system is recommended for all types of enterprises!

A few important aspects must be considered to make managing recurring payments more efficient:

    Define goals: your company must establish KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to assess the status of recurring billing. KPIs can measure delinquency, monthly revenue, and even customer churn rates.
    Have a billing policy for overdue customers: even with reminders, some customers will miss payments. For this reason, your company should define an action plan that includes billing strategies and even a deadline for taking legal action to receive what is owed in.
    Use collection software: an intelligent system is essential for monitoring and managing contracts. A technology platform can identify customers who owe and display their entire history – which helps with decision making.

What is a payment gateway?
A payment gateway is a system that acts as an intermediary between store and customer.
It works like this: a customer purchases a product and enters their credit card information in a payment portal. The gateway will communicate with the customer's operating company, process the transaction, and then release the funds (or not).
A gateway functions similarly to a credit card terminal, connecting businesses to different acquirers. Everything happens in a split second, but the company and buyer are completely secure.
What is an acquirer?
Since we’ve mentioned acquirers, it’s worth explaining a little more about them. Acquirers are companies that settle financial transactions.
They will communicate with the card issuers used by customers and with the banks so that purchases can be processed.
After approval, the acquirer receives the purchase money and transfers it to the store within previously established deadlines.
